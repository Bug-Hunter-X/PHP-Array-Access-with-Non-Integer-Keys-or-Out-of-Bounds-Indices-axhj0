This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in PHP related to accessing array elements using incorrect keys or indices.  The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version.  The problem is PHP's loose typing allows string keys when numeric indices are implicitly assumed which can lead to unexpected behaviour or silent data loss.  The solution involves careful input validation and using isset() or array_key_exists() to check for the existence of keys before accessing them.
