This code attempts to access an array element using a non-integer key.  PHP will issue a warning, but it might not always behave as expected, potentially leading to unexpected results or data loss.

```php
<?php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
echo $myArray['c']; // Warning: Undefined array key "c" in ...
echo $myArray[2]; // Notice: Undefined offset: 2 in ...
?>
```

The issue is using 'c' as the key, which is a string, and accessing array elements that don't exist (e.g., index 2).  PHP's loose typing allows this, but it's error-prone.  A similar problem can arise with keys that are mistakenly treated as integers when they are strings.  The code might seemingly run, but produce incorrect results because of this type juggling.
