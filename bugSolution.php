The solution involves using `isset()` or `array_key_exists()` to check if a key exists before trying to access it.  Additionally, ensure that when using numeric indices that those indices are truly valid. Using `empty()` might also be relevant for checking if the array is empty, avoiding unnecessary checks on an empty array.

```php
<?php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];

if (isset($myArray['c'])) {
  echo $myArray['c'];
} else {
  echo 'Key "c" does not exist';
}

if (array_key_exists(2, $myArray)) {
  echo $myArray[2];
} else {
  echo 'Index 2 does not exist';
}

// Safer way to iterate through array ensuring that keys exist before accessing them.
foreach ($myArray as $key => $value) {
    echo "Key: " . $key . ", Value: " . $value . "\n";
}
?>
```
This improved code explicitly checks for the existence of the key before attempting to access it, preventing warnings and ensuring more robust code.
